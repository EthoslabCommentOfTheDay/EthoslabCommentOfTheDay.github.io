				"question": "Etho I don't want to spoil the party but the doors in your village need to be exposed to sunlight in order to count as valid doors for villager \"breeding\" (which I assume you want to do to get the other types of villagers). Please just check the wiki before you continue with the village I'd hate to see you spend hours on making a village and then have it not work as you intended. If you already knew this then never mind but I'm a bit worried here. Please thumbs up so Etho can see!",
				"qname":"cybernetic soldier",
				"answer": "So cybernetic soldier posted that comment last episode now to address it I... I do know this somebody posted on the Minecraft reddit's a few weeks ago how this all works; about needing a sunlight, and it checks five blocks in front of the door and five blocks behind and determines if it's a house that way. So when I do the project I will have sunlight down in the cave. "

				"qname":"robotkidXD",
				"answer": "Thank you for the tip. Yeah when I built that I wasn't really planning on using it much maybe just once in a while, but it turns out I'm using it a lot now so I probably will do that. Snow has a nice benefit where efficiency enchantments don't break the snow quicker so that is why you want to use snow so I'll do that. "

				"answer": "I do for tutorials pretty much always, but for everything else I don't. I've tried in the past but I've had problems: it takes too long- I only have 0.5 Mb/s upload speed which is terrible, so no plans on that until I get faster Internet (except for tutorials or anything else fancy) "
			},
			{
				"question": "Etho, you should bring back the suicide booth from the old LP world because now that we have entered chests you can access your items from where you spawn and if you do it you could make it more sophisticated with the multiple choice type thing for how you died. For example if you press one button and walk into the suicide booth you get crushed or if you press a different button you did killed by lava. And that would make the suicide booth more like Futurama which is what inspired you the first time.",
				"qname":"thelonewolf95",
				"answer": "I missed the suicide booth. I would do it here, but really the nether portals are quick, it takes me like a minute to go from base to base now which is nothing to complain about. If I was to ever build something far, far away then we might bring that back."
			},
			{
				"question": "Hey Etho, I found out there is more a more efficient way to place water for your sugarcane farm. You have to place one water block, then you go up two blocks and one left, there you place the next block. Another block you place up and two right from the first one. The fourth you place one down and two left from the first block. The last one you place two down and one right from the first one. After that, you can continue the pattern. Like this, you need less lilypads",
				"qname":"CHguenstig",
				"answer": "Basically he's telling me there's a better way of placing the sugarcane in the water. At first I thought it was the same thing as I did, but I plotted it down on paper and it IS better, so thank you for that suggestion. I may try to modify what I've got already to be that pattern or anything I put in in future, I'll use you use this pattern here so thank you for that."

				"question": "Etho your mob system is amazing! I built a mob system myself, but it's not working like yours :(. I have cleared like 3/4 of all of the caves. Maybe it's because I have a skeleton XP farm connected to it and it's an XP farm. If I turn it to drops only and the skeleton farm off (because I have a ton of bones and bows and arrows) it's still slow :(.",
				"qname":"Minecrafting0",
				"answer": "The skeleton farm shouldn't interfere unless you're using it, if it's not spawning skeletons it's not going to interfere at all. I will say this, the last little bit of lighting up the caves makes a huge difference, so finish it up. Do the last quarter and you will notice a big improvement on rates."

People got bored, so I'm trying to avoid showing it too much now but what I've got planned yet is to: clean up down there and make everything connect together well, maybe improve my way of getting them to the surface and maybe add some extra tunnels for transporting them underground. That's about it. It's actually full right now ,I need to harvest them or move them."

As far as the tutorial goes, there's basically three main rules I'm going by here: using grass for the floor, not using torches for lighting (that's the ultimate goal there's still some around which I have to deal with), and thirdly try to make everything I build go with the natural terrain without having to adjust it too much. so that's the rules to my man cave here. "

I very rarely died to mobs or anything in this game anymore, in single-player anyway, so to make it more challenging I just wear diamond boots (and I only wear diamond boots so I can ender pearl around quickly otherwise I would probably wear nothing)."

What actually happened is that I just finished the dice tunnel on the minecraft server, and I was really excited because I liked how that looked, but on a large scale I don't know if I can make it make it cool. That's kind of the reason I want to change."
			},
			{
				"question": "I still like the original block choice for the village. Stone brick, iron bars, lava. Like your Mindcrack blaze farm. That thing is the most epic-looking practical build I've yet seen in a let's play. I just think having a little piston door in the side of the man cave, which opens to a giant, deep, fiery pit full of your etho minions is supremely more epic than another snow build. Either way, I can't wait to see it, keep it up Etho, you are the greatest!",

I was thinking about a style for your village, seeing as how you like green grass and such, maybe you could make a huge tree in the middle of the cave you dug out for them, with the branches kind of holding up the ceiling. You could have pumpkins hanging from the tree which would look natural-ish, and then you'd use leaves and other materials and grass blocks for the ground. The houses could also look like they are hanging maybe, with wood etc.",
				"qname":"Watzitoya",
				"answer": "That is a pretty cool idea for the village and maybe I'll use it one day in the future, or somebody else will use it. You went on to say in another comment that it wouldn't really work here because of the dark green grass, but I could see you doing that in a village and it would be pretty cool, I think. "

What I would like them to focus on now, is to work at fixing the bugs that were introduced and also at optimizing the game although I am really excited about the 1.4 features - especially the item frames. I'm gonna use that in the storage room so that you can see what's in the chests from a distance. I think that's pretty cool, and there's a lot of other cool stuff but all in all I'm pretty happy with it. I just want them to focus on fixing bugs and stuff now. Yeah we're just gonna do one comment today, I will talk about one other thing real quick though, about comments and comment-etiquette. If you guys see something in the comments that is extremely rude or negative, or you know someone's just being a jerk, instead of replying to them just downvote their comment. If you reply to them it can cause these long comment chains to occur and it brings attention to it. It's best just to hide it if it's a really stupid comment. Just a reminder."

				"qname":"BeanxxBot",
				"answer": "Yeah, you know what I've been really tempted to use the snapshots in the let's play before. I was avoiding it completely because I didn't want to spoil the patches, but you know what happened? I saw so many videos about the features and saw everybody doing stuff with the features that were coming with the snapshots, that by the time it actually came out like 6 months later, or whatever it was, it actually came to be thata lot of it was already spoiled. So yeah, I don't mind waiting a few weeks for a patch but if you gotta wait months and months and months, chances are a lot of it's gonna be wrecked anyway, so as long as the patch is not super buggy, I think I may consider doing it soon. One thing that worries me about that though is that some people may avoid watching my let's play because I could potentially be spoiling the patch or the snapshots for them. I don't know, it's a tough decision. I would like to, but there's pros and cons to it. I'm not sure what you guys would think of it in general, but yeah good question."

I put a lot of thought into that thing. It's a shame and it wasn't able to fully complete it, but I did get a lot done and it was working really well so it was cool to see that. As far as from the viewers perspective, I think the best received thing I've ever built was general spazz's cannon in the 50k special. A lot of people seem to really like that. Also notable mentions are EATS road, the silverfish farm, and more recently, the sheep farm. I'm still pretty proud of that, even though it's not done. I don't know, there's a lot of things. The old storage room, even the design for this I'm pretty happy with this place here (the man cave). I don't know, there's a lot of things I'm pretty happy with. But yeah, it's a good question.

I didn't really hear anything from him about that I think he missed it, and then randomly like weeks later, months later, we were playing final fantasy and I said ternal again and guude just kind of freaked out and said 'WHEN DID I EVER SAY TURNEL' and it just made me laugh.

Turns out I think it's like a 10% or something chance that when a zombie spawns they can become a zombie villager. The other day I went out looking for him as I trying to repopulate that first village I found. I was going to cure him. I lured a zombie villager into one of the houses, blocked it off, and I was going to enter pearl out BUT he cornered me and killed me. When I came back to my stuff, since they despawn, he was gone because I was out of range. When I came back for my stuff, my armor, my enchanted armor including my feather falling IV boots, and also my sharpness IV sword was gone, because he picked it up and then he spawned, so I lost the ton of stuff from that which sucked."

				"qname":"BaconLettucePickles",

He said he has subscribed to me and does watch the occasional video, but as you can imagine he's a busy guy he doesn't have a whole lot of time to do things like that. With this thing specifically, he said he made that change before he saw my video (he said he did watch my video) but this is a change that a lot of people would come up with, not me specifically. It's something a lot of people would want so that's how this got changed. Some things might be a bit more specific, like that whole mob egg thing I talked about today. By the way, if that was implemented, I think it makes sense to have to weaken the mobs first kind of like you do in Pokemon. I really hope that gets added because I want mob eggs in vanilla. If that was to get added it would probably be because somebody watched my episode, or a lot of people watched my episode, and tried to convey that idea to to Dinnerbone or somebody else at Mojang, and again that would not be directly because of me, only indirectly. So that's the answer to that."

So guys stop feeding the trolls. If it's obviously a stupid comment, just down vote it and it'll get hidden away and I can delete it. If people reply to it, if hundreds of people reply to something, I have to either just let it fly, which makes the comments full of spam, or delete every one of those which takes so long.

				"question": "Dear Etho, I don't think I'm the only one wondering this, does your minecraft blaze farm work better than your single-player world? Also, I think you should start giving a download link to just your good creations. By that I mean using MCEdit to make a Schematic, so we can just import it into our worlds. I would love to have your MindCrack blaze farm in my world. Thanks.",
				"qname":"Nick Lumz",
				"answer": "It does not, my single-player one is at least twice as quick. I would say that just because a lot of them on MindCrack die in the water. I wanted to use water for the fun of it, and it had a negative effect too, but the other option was to set up a whole ton of Pistons which is extremely laggy. So there's problems with both methods, but my single player one is quicker. [Part 2 of the question] Well you know you can copy stuff, and I think Sri has provided the download before, but really to have fun in this game even if you're taking or almost copying someone's design, if you just add a little bit of your own touch you'll have a lot more fun. Like don't do an exact copy, try to make it your own somehow and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more. It's just my recommendation so I'm not gonna be doing that."

				"question": "Hey Etho, in one of your first LP videos, you mentioned having trouble speaking and you figured making an LP would help you solve this problem. How do you think it's going? Personally I rarely notice and when you do it doesn't bother me. Keep up with the awesome videos man",
				"qname":"StephanBurgwal",
				"answer": "Yeah, you know what it is? see I'm kind of doing it right now, I kind of get stuck with my words. I can pretty clearly and fluently and precisely put my thoughts into text; if I'm writing something I can very clearly express myself, but when it comes to speaking I have trouble converting my thoughts in my brain into words that roll off my tongue like... butter? If I was writing I could have thought of something really clever there, I'm sure. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. In my LP you don't really notice it because I have the ability to edit and I tend to cut bits out. If I really mess up I'll cut it out or I'll even rerecord something if it's really bad, which does happen. In fact just reading the comments I messed up so I restarted. Usually it happens within the first 5-10 seconds though, if I'm going to mess up. There's definitely a difference; if you watch my first LP episodes and compare them to now, there's a lot more power and confidence in my voice which is sort of a skill I've been learning. It's a really important skill to learn too. I know I notice with a lot of new LPers they seem very uncomfortable, I was one of them, and they tend to talk like this and they don't really put any feeling into their words and no power. You lose your audience if you talk like that, you gotta speak with feeling, with power! Anyway, I'm improving but it's a slow and steady thing, I think."

				"question": "Dear Etho, lately I've noticed that you clip away very much of the things you upload. I would like you to not clip away as much as you do, some things does not hurt to watch, like when you farm in an uncharted territory! But when you dug as much as you did in the MincCrack episodes, it got boring. I really like your videos, keep up the good work!!",
				"qname":"ErenBrusmisbruk",
				"answer": "Thank you. The whole clipping thing is one of the ways I help or one of the ways I tried to make my LP unique from other LPS, at least at the time. Now you might see it more often, but when I first started people pretty much uploaded a straight 15 to 20 minutes period of them playing and I was doing clipping and stuff. It's a really hard balance to find, I find, and I know sometimes there's stuff I should include but I just totally skip because I don't feel like putting on my headphonesm, making sure everything around me is soundproof so it won't interfere with my recording etc. So there's some laziness involved with that. Specifically with uncharted territories when I'm farming in it, I've been doing montages of that. I do watch a lot of other people play CTM maps, and the thing I notice is that they either include ALL of the farming or people just cut it out completely and just get past it, so I think I have a good balance with that. With the Minecraft episodes of me digging, I've actually only shown like one or two percent of me digging that hole, out of the actual time involved. That's all I'm doing lately on the MindCrack server, just digging that hole. I could either try to make an episode out of it or just skip it completely. I've been trying to do fun stuff on the server as I do that and I think it's been working out okay to sort of buy me some time. It is about done but yeah, I think my MindCrack episode coming out after this for the day after or whatever. I'm still working on getting the right balance with the clip being in it, it's probably something I'll never totally master."
